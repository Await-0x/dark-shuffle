🔧 Powerful Infrastructure for Enhanced Gameplay

Dark Shuffle uses Cartridge VRF to guarantee randomness in every draft, shuffle, and draw — ensuring fairness for everyone, from players to developers.
No hidden advantages, just pure strategy. 🎲
With Cartridge Controller, experience gasless, transaction-free gaming powered by session keys and paymaster support.
And yes, it comes with Controller Achievements, making every milestone feel epic! 🏆


🌌 A Game Rooted in Realms World

Dark Shuffle is proudly built within the Realms World, a DAO-driven ecosystem where games unite under the LORDS token.
A portion of the entry fees goes to veLORDS, rewarding stakers and powering the stability of the network.
Initially funded by the Realms DAO, Dark Shuffle stands as a testament to collaborative innovation and decentralized creativity. 🎮
Your gameplay fuels the ecosystem and contributes to a larger vision. 🚀



🏅 Pioneering On-Chain Tournaments

Dark Shuffle runs in seasons, where top players claim the season pool from entry fees.
But the future lies in Provable Games’ tournament contracts.
These contracts will replace seasons, allowing any game to host highly customizable on-chain tournaments.
From unique rulesets to tailored rewards, the possibilities are endless for developers and players alike.
